  abstract = {The structure of a bipartite interaction network can be described by providing a clustering for each of the two types of nodes. Such clusterings are outputted by fitting a Latent Block Model (LBM) on an observed network that comes from a sampling of species interactions in the field. However, the sampling is limited and possibly uneven. This may jeopardize the fit of the LBM and then the description of the structure of the network by detecting structures which result from the sampling and not from actual underlying ecological phenomena. If the observed interaction network consists of a weighted bipartite network where the number of observed interactions between two species is available, the sampling efforts for all species can be estimated and used to correct the LBM fit. We propose to combine an observation model that accounts for sampling and an LBM for describing the structure of underlying possible ecological interactions. We develop an original inference procedure for this model, the efficiency of which is demonstrated in simulation studies. The practical interest in ecology of our model is highlighted on a large dataset of plant-pollinator network.},

  abstract = {Different studies have shown that microbial communities living in animals (humans included), in or around plants have a significant impact on health and disease of their host and on various services, such as adaptation under stressing environment. The basic input data to study microbiomes is a matrix representing abundance data of micro-organisms across different sampling units. Such a matrix typically corresponds to taxonomic profiles derived from the high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples. Biclustering is one way to study the interactions between the structure of micro-organism communities and the environmental samples they come from. We propose a latent block model (LBM) and an associated inference procedure for the biclustering of rows and columns of abundance matrices. The LBM assumes that micro-organisms (rows) and environmental samples (columns) can both be clustered into groups characterizing preferential interaction or avoidance. We use the Poisson–Gamma distribution to model the overdispersion observed in microbial abundance data and introduce row and column effects to account for the sequencing effort in each sample and the mean abundance of each micro-organism. Because the latent variables are not independent conditionally on the observed ones, classical maximum likelihood inference is intractable. We then derive a variational-based inference algorithm and propose a strategy to select the number of biclusters. We illustrate the flexibility and performance of our approach both on a simulation study and on three ecological datasets. The model-based framework allows us to adapt to peculiarities of microbial ecological abundance data and allows us to explore relationships between entities of two different natures. We implemented our method in the cobiclust R package available on the CRAN and built a website with example of usage (https://julieaubert.github.io/cobiclust/cobiclust-example1.html).},

  abstract = {Let a collection of networks represent interactions within several (social or ecological) systems. We pursue two objectives: identifying similarities in the topological structures that are held in common between the networks and clustering the collection into sub-collections of structurally homogeneous networks. We tackle these two questions with a probabilistic model based approach. We propose an extension of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) adapted to the joint modeling of a collection of networks. The networks in the collection are assumed to be independent realizations of SBMs. The common connectivity structure is imposed through the equality of some parameters. The model parameters are estimated with a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We derive an ad-hoc penalized likelihood criterion to select the number of blocks and to assess the adequacy of the consensus found between the structures of the different networks. This same criterion can also be used to cluster networks on the basis of their connectivity structure. It thus provides a partition of the collection into subsets of structurally homogeneous networks. The relevance of our proposition is assessed on two collections of ecological networks. First, an application to three stream food webs reveals the homogeneity of their structures and the correspondence between groups of species in different ecosystems playing equivalent ecological roles. Moreover, the joint analysis allows a finer analysis of the structure of smaller networks. Second, we cluster 67 food webs according to their connectivity structures and demonstrate that five mesoscale structures are sufficient to describe this collection.},

  abstract = {Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50\% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species’ phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species’ interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species’ interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.},

  abstract = {Pollinators provide crucial ecosystem services that underpin to wild plant reproduction and yields of insect-pollinated crops. Understanding the relative impacts of anthropogenic pressures and climate on the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks is vital considering ongoing global change and pollinator decline. Our ability to predict the consequences of global change for pollinator assemblages worldwide requires global syntheses, but these analytical approaches may be hindered by variable methods among studies that either invalidate comparisons or mask biological phenomena. Here we conducted a synthetic analysis that assesses the relative impact of anthropogenic pressures and climatic variability, and accounts for heterogeneity in sampling methodology to reveal network responses at the global scale. We analyzed an extensive dataset, comprising 295 networks over 123 locations all over the world, and reporting over 50,000 interactions between flowering plant species and their insect visitors. Our study revealed that anthropogenic pressures correlate with an increase in generalism in pollination networks while pollinator richness and taxonomic composition are more related to climatic variables with an increase in dipteran pollinator richness associated with cooler temperatures. The contrasting response of species richness and generalism of the plant–pollinator networks stresses the importance of considering interaction network structure alongside diversity in ecological monitoring. In addition, differences in sampling design explained more variation than anthropogenic pressures or climate on both pollination networks richness and generalism, highlighting the crucial need to report and incorporate sampling design in macroecological comparative studies of pollination networks. As a whole, our study reveals a potential human impact on pollination networks at a global scale. However, further research is needed to evaluate potential consequences of loss of specialist species and their unique ecological interactions and evolutionary pathways on the ecosystem pollination function at a global scale.},

This model allows one to embed simultaneous clustering of objects and variables in a mixture approach. We have studied this probabilistic model under the classification likelihood approach and developed a new algorithm for simultaneous partitioning based on the classification EM algorithm. In this paper, we consider the block clustering problem under the maximum likelihood approach and the goal of our contribution is to estimate the parameters of this model. Unfortunately, the application of the EM algorithm for the block mixture model cannot be made directly; difficulties arise due to the dependence structure in the model and approximations are required. Using a variational approximation, we propose a generalized EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of the block mixture model and, to illustrate our approach, we study the case of binary data by using a Bernoulli block mixture.},

Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1.},

  abstract = {The latest advances in high-throughput techniques during the past decade allowed the systems biology field to expand significantly. Today, the focus of biologists has shifted from the study of individual biological components to the study of complex biological systems and their dynamics at a larger scale. Through the discovery of novel bioentity relationships, researchers reveal new information about biological functions and processes. Graphs are widely used to represent bioentities such as proteins, genes, small molecules, ligands, and others such as nodes and their connections as edges within a network. In this review, special focus is given to the usability of bipartite graphs and their impact on the field of network biology and medicine. Furthermore, their topological properties and how these can be applied to certain biological case studies are discussed. Finally, available methodologies and software are presented, and useful insights on how bipartite graphs can shape the path toward the solution of challenging biological problems are provided.},

  abstract = {Pollination interaction networks exhibit structural regularities across a wide range of natural environments. Long-tailed degree distribution, nestedness, and modularity are the most prevalent topological patterns found in most bipartite networks analyzed up to day. In this work we evaluate the variation of these topological properties along an altitudinal gradient. To this end, we examined four plant–pollinator networks from the Chilean Andes at 33°S, in range from 1800 to 3600m elevation. Our results indicate that network topology is strongly and systematically affected by elevation. At increasing altitude, the number of potential visitors per plant decreased, and species’ degree distributions are closer to random expectations. On the other hand, the nested structure of mutualistic interactions systematically decreased with elevation, and network modularity was significantly higher than random expectations over the entire altitudinal range. In addition, at increasing elevations the pollination networks were organized in fewer and more strongly connected modules. Our results suggest that the severe abiotic conditions found at increased elevations translate into less organized pollination networks.},

  abstract = {blockmodeling for graphs is proposed. The model assumes that the vertices of the graph are partitioned into two unknown blocks and that the probability of an edge between two vertices depends only on the blocks to which they belong. Statistical procedures are derived for estimating the probabilities of edges and for predicting the block structure from observations of the edge pattern only. ML estimators can be computed using the EM algorithm, but this strategy is practical only for small graphs. A Bayesian estimator, based on the Gibbs sampling, is proposed. This estimator is practical also for large graphs. When ML estimators are used, the block structure can be predicted based on predictive likelihood. When Gibbs sampling is used, the block structure can be predicted from posterior predictive probabilities. A side result is that when the number of vertices tends to infinity while the probabilities remain constant, the block structure can be recovered correctly with probability tending to 1.},
